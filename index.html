            <p>I willdearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones
                have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a
                awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and
                work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow
                by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will
                dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him</p> <p class="name">Mushy
                </p>
            <h3>so sad</h3> <p>As I heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences from
                my MacBook Pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot be
                rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family and
                friends.</p> <p class="name">Tracy</p>
            <h3>Steve Jobs</h3> <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written
                as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple.I
                interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered
                PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid
                And through his vision, have been able to realize my own. Youll be
                missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work</p> <p class="name">Janna from Seattle,WA</p>
            <h3>He's gone.</h3> <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like -
                knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was
                taken too soon. can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly
                gained an angel.</p> <p class="name">Anonymous </p>
            <h3>Condolence </h3> <p>Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs,
                the great leader and creator in the world.I believe he would go to a more
                beautiful place and he would lie to see a stronger Apple. We will remember
                him forever.</p> <p class="name">Yibo from P.R. China</p>
            <h3>thank you</h3> <p>Never got a chance to thank you for every thing you have done for all of us.
                Your thoughts are an inspiration and your legacy shall be followed. Now is
                time for you to rest in peace.</p> <p class="name">Paulo</p>
            <h3>I will always remember Steve! </h3> <p>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to describe
                my feelings... For me Apple means a lot - got a good job using Apple
                products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've
                been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is
                connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a
                genius</p> <p class="name">Eugene </p>

                has touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he
                willive on in spirit, through the lives of all who knew him well. As a sign of
